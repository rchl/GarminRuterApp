# GarminRuterApp
An app for Garmin watches for checking Oslo public transport (using public Ruter API).
Currently only vivoactive (non-HR) watch is supported as that's the watch I use and
didn't have time to spend on adjusting UI to other watches/shapes.

## Installation
Currently there are no binaries provided so to run the app, one needs to [setup a developer's environment](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/getting-started/) and compile the code him/herself.
